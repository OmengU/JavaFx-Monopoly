# JavaFx-Monopoly
In this school project I am going to (try to) implement the game "Monopoly" in Java using the software platform JavaFX
## General Information
The game will support 2-4 players. On the start of a game, each player will recieve a certain (possibly definable) amount of a fictional currency i call **PiBucks(Ï€)**. Unlike real Monopoly there aren't any bills players need to keep track of. PiBucks are an entirely digital currency. The game will also feature a lot of (unfunny) memes, so that the game will be more fun and also to distract from my terrible programming (ðŸ˜‰).
## Flow of the game
In the beginning of the game each player will role dice and land on a random field in result. The game will feature these fields:
### Property fields
When players land on these fields, they can acquire them. So, if another player lands on a field that has already been sold to another player, they have to pay the owner of the field the value of all fields the owner has combined.
### "Special card" field
When a player lands on these fields, they will be given a random card (I will use JavaFX alerts for that), that will either give them an advantage or slow them down / hurt them. These cards will feature a lot of unfunny memes.
