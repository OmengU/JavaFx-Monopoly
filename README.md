# JavaFx-Monopoly
In this school project I am going to (try to) implement the game "Monopoly" in Java using the software platform JavaFX
## General Information
The game will support 2-4 players. On the start of a game, each player will recieve a certain (possibly definable) amount of a fictional currency i call **PiBucks(π)**. Unlike real Monopoly there aren't any bills players need to keep track of. PiBucks are an entirely digital currency. The game will also feature a lot of (unfunny) memes, so that the game will be more fun and also to make it more distinct since another group is also implementing monopoly.
## Flow of the game
In the beginning of the game each player will role dice and land on a random field in result. The game will feature these fields:
### Property fields
When players land on these fields, they can acquire them. So, if another player lands on a field that has already been sold to another player, they have to pay the owner of the field the value of all fields the owner has combined. There will be 7 different classes of property fields which will be given different values (PiBucks):
|color|value|
|-----|----|
|blue|10 π |
|cyan|20 π|
|magenta|35 π|
|brown|50 π|
|red|69 π|
|yellow|80 π|
|orange| 100 π|
### "Special card" field
When a player lands on these fields, they will be given a random card (I will use JavaFX alerts for that), that will either give them an advantage or slow them down / hurt them. These cards will feature a lot of unfunny memes.
